The TimingAnalyzer
==================

Using the TimingAnalyzer, you can quickly draw timing diagrams and build
libraries of timing diagrams. Using the built-in analysis functions, you
can quickly find speed related design issues since setup and hold
violations are detected, reported, and shown in the diagrams.

You can draw the diagrams using the GUI or Python scripts.  Timing diagrams
can be created automatically from simulation VCD files so they can be 
annotated and used in documenation. Application notes included in the 
documentation desribe how to create Verilog or VHDL monitors that 
automatically generate timing diagrams.
