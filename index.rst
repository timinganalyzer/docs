The TimingAnalyzer
==================

Using the TimingAnalyzer, you can quickly draw timing diagrams and build
libraries of timing diagrams. Using the built-in analysis functions, you
can quickly find speed related design issues since setup and hold
violations are detected, reported, and shown in the diagrams.

You can draw the diagrams using the GUI or Python scripts.  Timing diagrams
are automatically created from simulation VCD files so they can be 
annotated and used in documenation. Application notes desribe how to create 
Verilog or VHDL monitors that automatically generate the diagrams are included.
