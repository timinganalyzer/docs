The TimingAnalyzer is free to use by anyone without any limitations and is 
currently licensed as “Freeware” while beta testing. When the first final 
version 1.0 is released, the license will change to a “Commercial” license. 
The “Commercial” license will require businesses to purchase the program,
but it will continue to be free for personal and academic use. The estimated 
cost of the program will be low and affordable for small companies.

During beta testing, no warranties or guarantees are provided by the author 
of the program. If you decide to use the program, you should be aware that 
it is a work in progress and issues occur. Issues reported are fixed as 
soon as possible. Many users have been building timing diagrams with the 
program and it is considered to be stable and reliable and ready for 
everyday use.
