Highlights
==========


* Use the GUI to quickly draw timing diagrams.
* Use simple Python scripts to draw timing diagrams, generate test vectors,
  build testbenches, or add new features to the program.
* Quickly find timing violations in digital logic.
* Use synchronous and combinatorial logic functions to simplify drawing 
  more complex diagrams.
* Draw diagrams directly from VHDL Simulations App Note
* Draw diagrams directly from Verilog Simulations App Note
* Read VCD files and convert to timing diagrams automatically
* Diagrams are saved in simple text format which can modified with text editor.
* Save diagrams in many image file formats and scalable vector formats so they
  can easily be added to technical documentation.
* Use with Visio. Save diagram as SVG and open with Visio. Ungroup to edit any
  part of the diagram.
* Written in Java, it runs on any platform that supports the Java Run-time 
  Environment, JRE1.6.0 or Java Development Kit JDK1.6.0 or newer
