Introduction 
===============

Python scripts can be used to add new features, draw 
timing diagrams, generate test vectors, convert simulation waveform 
diagrams into timing diagrams, and check for timing constraint errors in 
digital logic systems.
  
Use any text editor to write the scripts and store them in the scripts 
directory.  Select “Script” from the file menu, a dialog listing all the 
scripts is displayed. Choose the script and hit the “Execute” button. 
It's best to start the TimingAnalyzer from the command line when 
developing and testing scripts because debugging information is output 
to the command window or shell.
